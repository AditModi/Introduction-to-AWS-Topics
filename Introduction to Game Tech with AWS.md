You’re imagining future games that delight players, and these games need the infrastructure and solutions to support your development. Bringing your ideas to life requires servers that can scale with tens of millions of players around the world. It requires databases that can process terabytes to petabytes of ever-changing data. It requires analytics solutions that can access that data with millisecond latency. And it requires machine learning that can speed up your processes and even translate into new, immersive gameplay. Players expect games to have regular and compelling updates. More efficient workflows can enable faster time to market when building your next game or migrating existing workloads.

# Build your game in the cloud

Reduce downtime and save costs
Improve gameplay and minimize latency with backend infrastructure that’s closer to your players. Decrease operational costs during low-demand periods using serverless architectures and servers with automatic scaling. With AWS’s infrastructure, studios can pay only for the resources they use instead of investing in servers upfront.
 
# Increase productivity and efficiency

Deploy new game features faster, expand capacity to meet player demand, and reduce fraud and cheating. Reduce the amount of building and testing needed to launch your game using automation and managed services that are designed for game workloads. With over 1 million active customers across 190 countries, 24 regions, 77 Availability Zones, studios can have new IT resources available in just a few clicks, increasing agility.

# Extend player lifetime value (LTV)

Extend the life of your game and keep innovating with services that help you understand your players and keep them engaged longer. With 175+ services supporting virtually any cloud workload, developers can de-provision servers as needed enabling them to experiment often and fail fast if a game idea doesn’t work.

# Enable innovation with a trusted partner

Build highly available multiplayer games with global reach, automatic scaling, and intelligent matchmaking. We provide the core staples of technology infrastructure, so studios can focus on developing the engagement with players rather than on infrastructure.

## GameLift hosting

Amazon GameLift offers a fully managed service for deploying, operating, and scaling session-based, multiplayer game servers. GameLift replaces the work required to host your own custom game servers, including buying and setting up hardware, and managing ongoing activity, security, storage, and performance tracking. Auto-scaling capabilities provide additional protection from having to pay for more resources than you need, while making sure you always have games available for new players to join with minimal waiting.

To learn more about how the GameLift hosting solution works, see [How GameLift works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-howitworks.html).

## GameLift hosting with Realtime Servers

Use Realtime Servers to stand up games that don't need custom-built game servers. This lightweight server solution provides ready-to-go game servers that can be configured to fit your game. You can deploy game servers with anything from minimal configuration settings to custom logic that is specific to your game and players.

To learn more about how GameLift hosting with Realtime Servers works, see [How Realtime Servers Work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/realtime-howitworks.html).

## GameLift FleetIQ

GameLift FleetIQ optimizes the use of low-cost Spot Instances for cloud-based game hosting. With this feature, you can work directly with your hosting resources in Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling and take advantage of GameLift optimizations to deliver inexpensive, resilient game hosting for your players. This solution is designed for game developers who need more flexibility than is offered in the fully managed GameLift solutions.

# Conclusion

traditional streaming approaches for 3D interactive content and applications like online gaming have difficulty reaching this level of concurrency. The cost is prohibitive, and even if budgets were limitless, the cloud GPU hardware is just not available to scale. To ensure the future of our cloud gaming for changing experiences and immersive environments we must face the realities of current approaches head-on and redefine scale to incorporate the concepts of concurrency, reach and new experiences.  Driving towards a future where the possibilities are limitless, leading to games being built in a cloud-first approach.
