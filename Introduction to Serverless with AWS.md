**The serverless computing model** allows you to build and run applications and services without having to worry about infrastructure or servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, scaling, and capacity provisioning. 

In this blogpost, I would like to give you an overview of some fully-managed serverless services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which can be used to create fully cloud-native serverless applications.

Building native serverless applications means that developers can focus on the **core product** and on **innovating applications and solutions**, rather than spending a lot of time on setting up and maintaining infrastructure. This results in many benefits such as faster development, simplified operational management, scaling, and reduction in operational costs. Take a look at my last blogpost to get an impression on serverless architectures and how they impact the development process and the project business.

But how can we actually implement these serverless applications? What tools and services should I use to create a highly-available, scalable and performant backend solution? How can I benefit from managed infrastructure, variable operational costs that scale with my business? How can I increase speed and agility in my development process?

Compute provides you with the execution environment for your application code.

[**With AWS Lambda**](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), you can execute code as a function triggered by various event sources like, e.g., HTTP requests on AWS API Gateway, file updates on S3, or metric alarms in AWS Cloudwatch. Lambda is the FaaS solution from AWS where you can run code for any type of application or backend service. It runs the code on a fully-managed, high-available infrastructure and performs all administration tasks of the compute resources, including server and system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. You pay only for the compute time your application actually consumes. Lambda can be combined with many other AWS services and is used in many scenarios, like authorizing a HTTP request by validating a JSON web token, real-time filtering and transforming streaming data, processing data in S3, managing database handling, and many more.
